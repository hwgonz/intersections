# intersections

This service calculates the Shortest Path between 2 intersections and also returns the total transit time between them

Usage

First, put the input data (like sample-data.json) in the project's root folder
Then use sbt run
When asked for the Input file, you can just hit Enter to use the default sample-data.json
When asked for start intersection, introduce the starting intersection
Finally when asked for the end intersection, introduce the ending intersection

The service should output the Average transit times, the total transit time and the shortest path
